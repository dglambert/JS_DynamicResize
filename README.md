DYNAMICRESIZE

DynamicResize is a web page using JavaScript to change the way the page is displayed dependant on the width of the browser window. Different widths are supported based on different resolutions. In order exemplify this the program makes use of different colors for different widths. This sort of exercise was created to deal with the way your content would be viewed on different resolution screens, I have a feeling the exercise will come in handy in the future and I found it very educational. This project was used as an introduction to JavaScript. This was also my first time using Visual Studio and the debugger in IE for JavaScript, before I had just been using Notepad++.
